```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this analysis I will plot the distribution of signal sites upstream of the PAS I have found. 


First I use a python script to make a bed file with the 100 base pairs upsream of the PAS:

```{bash,eval=F}
module load Anaconda3
source activate three-prime-env
mkdir ../data/SignalSiteFiles
python Upstream10Bases_general.py ../data/PAS/APAPAS_GeneLocAnno.5perc.bed ../data/SignalSiteFiles/APAPAS_100up.bed
```


Now I use bedtools nuc to get the sequence for each of these regions:  
```{bash,eval=F}
sbatch getSeq100up.sh 
```
