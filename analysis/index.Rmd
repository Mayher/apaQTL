Welcome to my research website.


##Preprocessing:

In the preprocessing steps of the analysis I will go from the fastq files that come off the sequencer to the PAS I will use for the rest of the analysis. 

* [Process fastq to cleaned bam files](fastq2bam.html)

* [Process bam to PAS](bam2pas.html) 


##QC:

These files create some of the QC metrics I used for the analysis.

* [Look at PAS usage differences by gene coverage](PASusageQC.html)
