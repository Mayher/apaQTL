Welcome to my research website.


##Preprocessing:

In the preprocessing steps of the analysis I will go from the fastq files that come off the sequencer to the PAS I will use for the rest of the analysis. 

* [Process fastq to cleaned bam files](fastq2bam.html)

* [Process bam to PAS](bam2pas.html) 


##QC and base visualization:

These files create some of the QC metrics I used for the analysis.

* [Look at PAS usage differences by gene coverage](PASusageQC.html) 

* [Look at read distribution accross features](Readdistagainstfeatures.html) 

* [Make descriptive plots for called PAS](PASdescriptiveplots.html)  

* [Plot signal site dristributions](signalsiteanalysis.html)

* [Count and usage correlation](corrbetweenind.html)

* [Sequencing meta data by batch](seqmetadatanalysis.html)  

* [Understand new PAS](NewvOldPeakQC.html)  

* [Compare new and old data](recomputeusageold.html)

* [Look at coverage in 3' UTR](reads2UTR.html)  


##apaQTL  


* [Call apaQTLs in both fractions](mapapaQTL.html)  

* [Check for batch effects in new QTLs](newQTLheatmap.html)  

* [Look at how many PCs I should include](choosePCs.html)

* [Rerun qtl with PCs from previous analysis](rerunQTL_changePC.html)

* [apaQTL in opposite fraction](apaQTLoverlap.html)

##Differential Isoform Analysis  

* [Run leafcutter to compare fractions](DiffIsoAnalysis.html)  

* [Results when logef > 0.5](diffiso_logef5.html)  

* [Results when logef > 1](diffuse_logef1.html) 

* [Regulatory correlation heatmap](rna_netseq_h3k12ac.html)  

* [Relationship between APA fraction and nascent transcription](nascenttranscription.html)  

* [Location of nuclear intronic peaks along introns](nucintronicanalysis.html)
