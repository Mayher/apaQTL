```

In this analysis I will create the read distribution figures. These are created using deeptools. I have merged total and nuclear bam files from the read mapping pipeline. I will convert these to bigwigs in order to map the reads against features with deeptools. 


##Create BW files  
```{bash,eval=F}
mkdir ../data/mergedBW_byfrac
mkdir ../data/DTmatrix
mkdir ../output/dtPlots

module load Anaconda3 
source activate three-prime-env

sbatch bam2bw.sh ../data/mergedbyFracBam/Total.SamplesMerged.sort.bam ../data/mergedBW_byfrac/Total.SamplesMerged.bw sbatch bam2bw.sh ../data/mergedbyFracBam/Nuclear.SamplesMerged.sort.bam ../data/mergedBW_byfrac/Nuclear.SamplesMerged.bw
```

##Map along gene bodies  


```{bash,eval=F}
sbatch BothFracDTPlotGeneRegions.sh
```
